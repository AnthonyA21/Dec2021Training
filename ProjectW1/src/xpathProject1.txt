1. Page: /text-box. Write the xpath that will return the ‘Full Name’textbox using the ID attribute. Hint: This element has the ‘input’tag.
$x("//input[@id='userName']")

2. Page: /buttons. Write the xpath that will return all elements on the page with the ‘button’tag.
Note: this one wasn't entirely clear to me. There is a 4th button on this page:
<button class="navbar-toggler" type="button"><span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span></button>
If the results should include this button as well, the following XPath can be used:
$x("//button")
If it's supposed to return the same results as the CSS exercise, this XPath can be used:
$x("//button[@class='btn btn-primary']")

3. Page: /webtables. Write the xpath that will return the div with text of ‘Vega’. Ensure to narrow the scope of your xpath to the ReactTable and 
ensure that your xpath is limited to returning cells only. Cells in this table have the class ‘rt-td’. Hint: You must use “Vega” in your xpath.
This is not a good solution and probably not correct, but it's the closest I could get:
$x("//div[@class='ReactTable -striped -highlight']/div[@class='rt-table']/div[@class='rt-tbody']/div[@class='rt-tr-group']/div[@class='rt-tr -odd']/div[@class='rt-td' and contains(., 'Vega')]")

4. Page: /radio-button.Write the xpath that will return the parent element for the radio button with id=’impressiveRadio’.
$x("//*[@id='impressiveRadio']/parent::div")
Note: $x("//*[@id='impressiveRadio']/parent::*") could work in this specific case as well, but probably better to use div
to be more precise.

5. Page: /radio-button. Write the xpath that will return all DIV ancestors for the radio button with id=’impressiveRadio’.
$x("//*[@id='impressiveRadio']/ancestor::div")

6. Page: /radio-button: Write the xpath that will return the sibling for the radio button with id=’impressiveRadio’. Do not use the sibling axes. 
Navigate to the parent element then down to the sibling instead.
$x("//*[@class='col-12 mt-4 col-md-6']/child::div[1]/child::div[@class='custom-control custom-radio custom-control-inline'][1]")

7. Page: /buttons. Write the xpath that will return all buttons containing the value “Click”.
$x("//button[contains(text(),'Click')]")
